## Important Projects

This specialization involves working on a few projects. The following are 3 of the more interesting projects:





### Algorithmic Trading: Econometric estimation of an Inverse Reinforcement Learning-based market portfolio model - Quantum Equlibrium-Disequlibrium (QED)(STILL UNDER OPTIMIZATION)
[Notebook](https://github.com/ktchan33GBC/Investment_Management_with_Python_and_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Course_3_Python%20and%20Machine%20Learning%20for%20Asset%20Management/notebook/Lab_5_Regime_Prediction_with_ML/Part3.ipynb)


+ Estimated the IRL model using the DJI portfolio of 30 stocks, first without signals, and then using simple signals such as simple moving averages.
+ Utilized a function that incorporates Kramers' escape in the regularization term to explore the implications of calibrated model parameters for default probabilities of stocks in our portfolio.
+ Conducted experiments with exponential weighted (EW) functions to investigate the impact on model calibration and applied to the SPX closing price dataset.
