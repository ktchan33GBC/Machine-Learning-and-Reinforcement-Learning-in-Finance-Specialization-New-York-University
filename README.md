## Important Project


### Algorithmic Trading: Econometric estimation of an Inverse Reinforcement Learning-based market portfolio model - Quantum Equlibrium-Disequlibrium (QED)(STILL UNDER OPTIMIZATION)
[Notebook](https://github.com/ktchan33GBC/Machine-Learning-and-Reinforcement-Learning-in-Finance-Specialization-New-York-University/blob/main/Course_4_Overview_of_Advanced_Methods_of_Reinforcement_Learning_in_Finance/Proj_QED_DJI_calibration.ipynb)


+ Estimated the IRL model using the DJI portfolio of 30 stocks, first without signals, and then using simple signals such as simple moving averages.
+ Utilized a function that incorporates Kramers' escape in the regularization term to explore the implications of calibrated model parameters for default probabilities of stocks in our portfolio.
+ Conducted experiments with exponential weighted (EW) functions to investigate the impact on model calibration and applied to the SPX closing price dataset.
