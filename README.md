## Important Projects

This specialization involves working on a few projects. The following are 3 of the more interesting projects:





### Algorithmic Trading: Regime Prediction with Machine Learning
[Notebook](https://github.com/ktchan33GBC/Investment_Management_with_Python_and_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Course_3_Python%20and%20Machine%20Learning%20for%20Asset%20Management/notebook/Lab_5_Regime_Prediction_with_ML/Part3.ipynb)


+ Forecasted US economic recessions using machine learning on leading macroeconomic indicators from 1959 to August 2020
+ Developed predictive models with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms.
+ Compared recession prediction probabilities across algorithms.

### Algorithmic Trading: Dynamic Risk Budgeting between Performance Seeking Portfolio and Goal Hedging Portfolio using a Drawdown Allocator

[Notebook](https://github.com/ktchan33GBC/Investment_Management_with_Python_and_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Course_1_Introduction%20to%20Portfolio%20Construction%20and%20Analysis%20with%20Python/Notebook/Lab129_Dynamic_risk_budgeting_between_PSP_%26_LHP.ipynb)


+ Developed a portfolio with a drawdown constraint, ensuring that losses are limited to a certain amount rather than having a fixed floor constraint. This approach balances potential gains with downside protection.
+ Backtested using historical data, the dynamic risk budgeting strategy with drawdown allocation achieved an annualized return of approximately 9%, slightly lower than the unconstrained market's 9.6%. However, it significantly reduced the maximum drawdown to the targeted 25%, compared to the market's 50%.
+ Additionally, a version with a fixed floor constraint using zero coupon bonds as a safe asset was developed.

### Algorithmic Trading:  Improving Equal Weight with Cap Weighted Tethering


[Notebook](https://github.com/ktchan33GBC/Investment_Management_with_Python_and_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Course_2_Advanced%20Portfolio%20Construction%20and%20Analysis%20with%20Python/notebook/Lab204_Backtesting_EW_vs_CW.ipynb) 

+ Optimized the performance of Equal Weight portfolios strategy.
+ Dealt with the disadvantages of traditional Equal Weight portfolios by excluding microcap stocks lacking liquidity, implementing weight limits as a multiple of cap weights, and enhancing tracking error reduction compared to the Cap-Weighted index.
+ Achieved a significant reduction in tracking error, decreasing it from 0.232 (Equal Weight vs. Cap Weighted portfolios) to 0.155 (Equal Weight Tethered portfolio vs. Cap Weighted portfolios).
